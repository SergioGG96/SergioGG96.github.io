# What is this blockout level prototype about?

The game is a simple physics-based 3D platformer where we control a ball. My intention was to create a balancing game in the style of [Super Monkey Ball](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball) where we will have to advance through a series of obstacles and platforms until we reach our goal. 

In the developed level the goal is to overcome 4 challenges collecting a special cube at the end of each one.

## Challenge A:

In this challenge we must first jump down a ramp to reach the platform, then we must go through a ring without falling to collect the cube.

## Challenge B:

This is the longest challenge, the player has to go through a holed tube without falling ...

... and then climb a tower with several obstacles until you reach the top and collect the cube.

## Challenge C:

In this challenge the player has to go through constantly rotating tubes, must keep his balance and reach the end to collect another cube.

## Challenge D:

In this challenge the player has to cross some platforms that move from left to right constantly, when he reaches the end he will get a cube.

The challenges can be overcome in any order the player wants.

It is used to propel the ball through the air and reach some platforms.

- Coins:

We can only collect them.

- And Teleporters:
