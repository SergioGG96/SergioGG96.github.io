# What is Polar Project

Polar Project is a prototype of a turn-based RPG strategy video game. Made with my own pixelart sprites using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and developed in [Unity](https://unity.com/es).

The characters of this video game consist of some penguins that are being attacked by a group of snowmen. The player will control them in order to clear the level.

# How to play

The player will control the penguins on a grid based map, each penguin has the possibility to move and attack once per turn. When we dont have more turns, when we have no moves left, we end the turn and the enemy will start to play.

If we defeat all the enemies we will complete the level, if we lose our penguins, we lose the game.
