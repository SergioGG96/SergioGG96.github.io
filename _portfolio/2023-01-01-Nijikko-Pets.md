# What is Nijikko Pets

The game consists of taking care of a virtual pet that we must be responsible for feeding, washing and playing with to keep it entertained.

All this happens in real time, at a certain time the pet will start to get hungry, dirty or bored.

The game has been developed using the Unity game engine for mobile (Android).

## What can we do together with the pet?
