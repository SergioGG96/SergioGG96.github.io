## I'm Sergio Gonz√°lez Guerra

I'm a Computer Engineer and a huge enthusiast when it comes to game Development.

I love to create and design games and even create graphic resources with my own pixelart, and still qualify as a junior developer, but willing to learn about this industry.

I have a great creativity when it comes to elaborate mechanics or new ideas for videogames.
