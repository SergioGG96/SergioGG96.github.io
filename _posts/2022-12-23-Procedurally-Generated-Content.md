## What things can create the Procedurally Generated Content

Can help you generate landscapes, creatures and some even entire planets. They can easily create living worlds. 

Thanks to this, [No man's sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/?cli_action=1671837129.548) was born, a game that is a procedurally generated universe. It is said to have 18 quintillion planets to explore.

That amount would be impossible to reach, but [Hello Games](https://hellogames.org/) managed to create it in only 3 years thanks to this type of algorithms.
