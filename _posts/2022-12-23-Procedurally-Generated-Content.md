# Procedurally Generated Content

The game development is usually a complicated task, especially if we need to generate worlds as big as some of them.

That is why the Procedurally Generated Content has appeared and saves us a lot of work.

## What things can create the Procedurally Generated Content

Can help you generate landscapes, creatures and some even entire planets. They can easily create living worlds. 

Thanks to this, "No man's sky" was born, a game that is a procedurally generated universe. It is said to have 18 quintillion planets to explore.

That amount would be impossible to reach, but [Hello Games](https://hellogames.org/) managed to create it in only 3 years thanks to this type of algorithms.
