# What types of jobs can we find in video game development?

The roles we can find are very diverse depending on the genre and the content of the video game we are playing. For example, games like [Super Mario Bros](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.), don't have a very complex story, they just use it as an excuse to play the game directly. So the role of writer does not exist here.

We can find works from the artistic section to other more technical ones such as programming.
So I will mention the ones that seem most important to me.

# How do they all work together?

Many of these roles come together to produce a single game element. For example when developing a character, programmers, 3D modelers, artists, animators, effects and sound designers, etc. may be needed.

All these roles work together and it is necessary to understand each other in order to make progress with the proposed objectives and move forward.
